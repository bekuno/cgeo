<h3>
We had to do extensive changes to the way c:geo gets access to your file system (e.g. for storing data, reading offline maps) to be prepared for requirements on new Android versions.
After upgrading to this c:geo version a wizard will guide you through the needed changes. Please follow these steps carefully!
<br>
Refer to <a href="https://faq.cgeo.org/#SAF">this FAQ entry</a> for more information.
